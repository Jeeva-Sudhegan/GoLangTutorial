CONCURRENCY:
    1. capability to deal with lots of things.
    2. e.g. jogging person switch from jogging to tie his/her shoe and resumes jogging from where he begin ( context switching concept in OS )
    3. which means he/she capable of doing many things

PARALLELISM:
    1. capability of dealing with lots of things at once.
    2. e.g. jogging person listening music while jogging simultaneously
    3. which means he is doing many things at the same time

In single core processor, context switch happens between process. 
So either one component does and other component waits and vice versa. => CONCURRENCY
If in case of multi core processor, both components process simultaneously => PARALLELISM

Parallelism are not always faster though, because there will be sometime where they need to communicate between each other.
This communication overhead is low in concurrency.
Whereas this communication overhead is high in parallelism.
